# calendar-grid-swift

A scrollable calendar grid for iOS, written in Swift 5.0

This sample code shows off how to build a full page calendar, which will scroll backwards through time. Each day is represented as square with the date on. Months are broken down into individual sections.

##  components

The code makes use of `UICollectionView`, along with custom `UICollectionViewCell` and `UICollectionReusableView` for all view related work.
